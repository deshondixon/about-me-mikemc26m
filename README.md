# LABs - 2 ,3, 4

## About Me - Lab 2

The index page tells the user about me. I added JS that promoted the user to guess yes or no to 5 questions.  

## Lab 3

I added JS to prompt the user to guess my favorite items and limited them on the number of guesses.

## Lab 4

In this lab I cloned repositories and had my partner add functions.
