  <header><h1>All About Me</h1></header>
  <p> Hello and thank you for visiting my page. My name is Mike and I live on the West Coast of the USA. I grew up in the mid-west and moved to Washington State 25 years ago where I raised my two kids, and I now have three grandchildren. </p>

      <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>After high school I went straight to work. I wanted to be an Air-Force pilot but my color-blindness stopped that from happening. During my career I attended factory training, college and university as needed. I have Certificates for Internet Fundamentals, Teaching and Pupil Transportation Management. My current education includes some really awesome classes in Software Development. </p></li>

      <h3>My Jobs</h3>
        <p>For 20 years I worked as a certified Ford - Lincoln technician. I then moved into K-12 where I was a bus driver, a teacher and an administrator. In my spare time I did learn HTML and built some websites but that has been more than two decades ago. A lot has changed and my memory isn't so great!</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>My current goals are to learn everything I can about software development. The more I work on HTML, CSS and JS, the more I am excited to see what the future holds!</p>
